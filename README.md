# RockPaperScissors

My second updated website.
I sat 6 hours working on this website.

Changelog #1:
# Add 2 new JavaScript Files
# Add main.html and 2 different CSS
# Add ending modal after 5 points
# script.js is old, but I didn't want to delete.


Plans for the future:
* Add custom rounds
* Add working links in footer
* Add custom color skins
* Maybe I'll come up with something new
